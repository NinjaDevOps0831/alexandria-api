## Running local docker on Windows.
Make sure you have the following programs installed:
1. https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
2. https://desktop.github.com/

When you use github desktop to checkout this codebase the code usually ends up in /Users/[your username]/Documents/GitHub/alexandria-api
and you have to navigate there with your windows PowerShell before you can continue with this guide: [/README.md](readme)
